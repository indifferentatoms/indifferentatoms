  <p> I've build a number of tools with <a
  href="https://sonic-pi.net/">sonic-pi</a> to help generate &
  improvise music. In this article, I'll give an overview of what they
  do and provide some pointers to demo music that used them.</p>

  <p> In the future, I'll be open sourcing each of the tools but they
  need a bit of clean up first to remove redundant code and make them
  easier to use.</p>

  <p>Each tool generates MIDI which is then edited by hand in <a
  href="https://www.ableton.com/en/live/">Ableton Live</a>. I used
  samples & piano sound from the <a
  href="https://www.korg.com/us/products/synthesizers/wavestate/">Korg
  Wavestate</a>.</p>

  <h2> Sonodoro </h2>

  <p>This software generates semi-random melodies and basic
  accompaniment. It also has a TouchOSC interface to allow me to listen
  a stream of melodies and send a like or dislike on my phone. I
  listened repeatedly to about 1,000 melodies then picked the
  most-liked ~50 melodies. I edited them in Ableton Live, modifying
  each melody and accompaniment by hand.</p>

  <p> From the selected melodies I arranged two 30 minute albums that
  can be used as Pomodoro timers for focussed work. So far I have
  released one track as a single. It's called <a
  href="assume-good-intent.html">Assume Good Intent and you can listen
  to it on most streaming platforms.</a></p>

  <h2> pi-layers </h2>
  
  <p>This track is a demo for sonic-pi software that I have built that
  implements a kind of arpeggiator inspired by <a
  href="https://www.spitfireaudio.com/olafur-arnalds-stratus">Ã“lafur
  Arnalds Stratus</a>. You can define patterns for each of the keys
  being played. These are defined in a tracker text representation and
  can be as simple as a single note or complex note swarms. You can
  setup a repeating chord progression and improvise a melody over the
  top. It also implements some note interval filtering to remove
  dissonance between the notes it generates.</p>
  
  <p>You can <a
  href="https://soundcloud.com/indifferentatoms/pi-layer-demo">listen
  to a demo on soundcloud</a>.</p>

<h2> isorhythmic </h2>

This tool represents multiple interacting melodies in sonic-pi 
then live-code / improvise by modifying them in real time. They are a
form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isorhythm">Isorhythmic
motet</a>. You can define melodies and rhythms separately and then
change them independently.</p>

<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
# Define melodic content for each MIDI voice
set("melody1", [])
set("melody2", [:G3, :A3, :G3, :A3, :B3, :A3])
set("melody3", [:D3, :E3, :D3, :E3])

# Define rhythmic patterns for each MIDI voice
set("rhythm_pattern1", []) 
set("rhythm_pattern2", [1, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]) # 4.0
set("rhythm_pattern3", [2.0, 2.0, 1.5, 2.5]) # 4.0
</pre>

<p>It also implements some note interval filtering to remove
  dissonance between notes from multiple interacting melodies.</p>

<p> You can <a
  href="https://soundcloud.com/indifferentatoms/isorythmic-demo">
  listen to a demo on soundcloud</a>.</p>

<h2> pi-tracker </h2>

This tool is a multi-track midi recorder / looper that can be
controlled from a keyboard so you can build a track by improvising
layer by layer without having to switch to a computer
keyboard/mouse. Later you can edit the midi in a text based tracker
representation. This can be edited in a sonic-pi buffer or in a normal
text file. Here is what a sequence looks like.

<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
midi_add_seq(0, 2, 
"S0  G2  D3 V59          

                G3 V32  

S4  A2  E3 V15          

                A3 V45  

S8  B2
        E3 V45          


S12             B3 V42  

    a2          A3 V39  

")
</pre>

<p>It also implements some note interval filtering to remove
  dissonance between notes from multiple interacting tracks and sequences.</p>
